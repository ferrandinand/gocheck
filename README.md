# GoCheck

This is a toy project to learn Golang and become gophers!

## Idea

The idea is to create a program that will be responsible to check whether a server is up or not. The basic functioning of the application is to ask the server every x units of time and produce an output.

## How to work/develop

We will be creating issues with the features that we will like to add and any of us can create a pull request to implement them. We will try to address the issues that carry the smallest modifications, so we can be as lean as possible.

## Coding style and best practices

- Default Golang coding style
- TDD everything
- YAGNI! (You ain't gonna need it!)
